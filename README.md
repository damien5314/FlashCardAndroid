# Purpose
Allow users to create vocabulary lists, and provide an interface for studying these lists.

# Functionality
- Vocabulary lists are stored in XML format allowing users to define the phrase they wish to study in its native characters, the phonetic spelling in its native language, the romanized spelling of the phrase, and the translation of the phrase into the user's native language.
- The same properties are available for defining sentence examples containing the phrase. Any number of sentences can be included with a phrase definition.
- Users can edit lists in their collection and add new phrases and example sentences.
- Lists are stored in user's Google Drive account for easy sharing.
- After selecting a list, users can view data about the list and the phrases included in the list.
- *Currently* there is one quiz type available for translating a phrase from its native spelling to the phonetic spelling, with more quiz types planned.
